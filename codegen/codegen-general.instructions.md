# Best coding practices

- **Modular Design:** Emphasize clear separation of concerns.
- **Preserve Comments:** Existing comments in code must be retained.
- Tables and columns in databases should use CamelCase, including those one-word names.
- Remember to refer to the library/package/tool documentation provided by the Context7 MCP if necessary and available.
